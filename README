This project holds a few special-purpose scripts for scraping some parts of the
Web.  If you find them useful, good for you.


fetch-lhv-thread.pl
===================

Pulls a thread down from the LHV forum and stores each post as an HTML fragment
and its author as a textfile.  Does no thread length discovery but attempts to
avoid re-fetching pages whose posts have already all been fetched.  There is no
user interface to speak of.

Note that "US persons" may be legally prohibited from reading the LHV forums.
